Galactic Dependencies v1.0 (referred to as “GD” in the rest of this 
document) is a collection of linguistic data and tools.  Each dataset 
within GD has its own license terms and you (the “User”) are responsible 
for complying with the license terms applicable to those parts of GD 
that you use. If you do not agree with the license terms, you must stop 
using GD and destroy all copies of GD data that you have obtained. 

Each GD dataset is adapted from a specific treebank that is 
distributed as part of the Universal Dependencies v1.2 collection 
(referred to as “UD” in the rest of this document).  Each GD dataset is 
licensed under the same terms as the UD treebank from which it is 
derived.  The license for each dataset is provided in its directory.

An overview of the UD treebanks and their license terms can be found at
https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/page/licence-UD-1.2.

You are specifically reminded that some of the treebanks permit only 
non-commercial usage.
